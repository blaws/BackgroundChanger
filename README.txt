BackgroundChanger
blaws

C program that pastes a random line from quotes.txt near the bottom of a 
random .bmp image from the directory, outputing the result as BG.bmp. If 
this file is set as the desktop background and the program is set to run 
at startup, a new background will appear with every login.

Before running, update line 10 of BackgroundChanger.c to give the path 
to the directory of images and quotes.txt, so that the executable can be 
correctly run from any directory (i.e. when it is scheduled by the 
system).

Written on Mac OSX 10.9.1.
