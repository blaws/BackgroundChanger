BackgroundChanger
blaws

C program that resizes a random .bmp file from the current directory to 
the screen size (1280x800 by default) and then pastes a random line from 
quotes.txt near the bottom of the image.

For a different screen size, change the windowW and windowH variables 
near the top of the program.

Written on Mac OSX 10.6.8; requires Aquaterm
