BackgroundChanger
blaws

C program that pastes a random line from quotes.txt near the bottom of a 
random .bmp image from the directory, outputing the result as BG.bmp. If 
this file is set as the desktop background and the program is set to run 
at startup, a new background will appear with every login.

Written on Mac OSX 10.9.1.
